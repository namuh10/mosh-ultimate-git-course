# 09- Renaming or Moving Files

When we rename a file and the run `git status` we will see the following output:

```zsh
❯ git status
On branch main

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    02 Creating Snapshots/09- Renaming or Moving.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	02 Creating Snapshots/09- Renaming or Moving Files.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We have to changes and both are unstaged. One that is a delete operation, and a new untracked file.

If we both files to the staging area and run `git status` one more time, we will see the following output:

```zsh
❯ git status
On branch main

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    02 Creating Snapshots/09- Renaming or Moving.md -> 02 Creating Snapshots/09- Renaming or Moving Files.md
```

Git recognizes that we renamed the file ank marks it as renamed. Like in the delete operation, there is a Git command to rename files:

Then we commit the changes:
p
```zsh
❯ git commit -m 'Rename file'
[main aec2762] Rename file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename 02 Creating Snapshots/{09- Renaming or Moving Files.md => 09- Renaming or Moving.md} (100%)
```

```zsh
git mv <current file> <new name>
```

When we use the `git mv` command the changes are applied to both the **Working Directory** and the **Staging Area**.



```zsh
>mv file.txt main.js
git add file.txt
git add main.js


git mv main.js main.txt

```
